# RISCV32_Project
This project implements a RISC-V 32-bit processor (RV32) with support for the base instruction set. The goal is to provide a lightweight, modular, and educational implementation of the RISC-V ISA that can be extended with additional features such as pipelining, interrupts, and peripherals.

ðŸš€ Features

Implements RV32I base instruction set

Instruction formats: R-type, I-type, S-type, B-type, U-type, J-type

Supports load/store, arithmetic/logic, and control flow instructions

Configurable memory module for instruction & data storage

Modular design (ALU, Register File, Control Unit, etc.)

Easy to extend with pipelining (IF/ID/EX/MEM/WB)

Written in [Verilog/VHDL/SystemVerilog/C++/other] (update accordingly)
